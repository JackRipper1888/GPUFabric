# gpuf-s API Server

## Base
- **Base URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:18081` by default; use `http://<host>:18081` only for a protected deployment
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`

## Frontend Integration And Security Defaults

The standalone management API now binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Start it with `--bind-addr 127.0.0.1` for local frontend development; choose `--bind-addr 0.0.0.0` only behind a reverse proxy/firewall and with deployment-level access control.

Existing REST paths and response envelopes remain compatible for frontends. The model APIs add optional `download_url`, `checksum`, and `expected_size` fields so UIs can show SHA256-verified artifact metadata without breaking older clients.
Control TLS is separate from this REST API. If the same deployment accepts remote gpuf-c workers over non-loopback networks, enable `gpuf-s --control-tls` and configure clients with `gpuf-c --control-tls --control-tls-server-name <name> --cert-chain-path <ca.pem>`. Mobile native workers can use the additive `startRemoteWorkerWithTls` SDK entry point; this does not change frontend REST paths or response envelopes. Android native SDK rebuild/test fixes validated on 2026-06-09 also do not require frontend REST changes.

## Common Response Envelope
All endpoints return this envelope type:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "message": "success",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-03T06:35:28.784161Z"
}
```

- **success**: `bool`
- **data**: `T | null`
- **message**: `string`
- **timestamp**: `RFC3339 string`

`GET /api/compute-map` is a frontend map payload and intentionally returns raw
JSON instead of this envelope.
`/api/banking/admin/*` endpoints use the frontend banking page envelope:

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "message": "ok",
  "data": {}
}
```

# Inference Gateway Notes

The management API in this document normally listens on the gpuf-s API server
port, for example `18081`. OpenAI-compatible inference uses the separate gpuf-s
inference gateway port, for example:

```text
http://<gpuf-s-host>:<inference_gateway_port>/v1/chat/completions
```

`POST /v1/chat/completions` accepts OpenAI-style message content in either
plain-text form or multimodal array form:

```json
{
  "model": "PaddleOCR-VL-1.6-GGUF",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "Please OCR this image and return the text."},
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "data:image/png;base64,<base64-image>"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "max_tokens": 256,
  "temperature": 0.0,
  "stream": false
}
```

Routing behavior:

- Plain string `messages[].content` remains backward-compatible and is sent to
  workers as the original chat task protocol.
- Array `messages[].content` is sent as the newer chat task protocol and
  requires an updated non-Android `gpuf-c` worker with multimodal llama.cpp
  support. The `cuda`, `vulkan`, `metal`, and `cpu` gpuf-c feature builds
  include the multimodal feature.
- Supported part types are `text`, `image_url`, `image`, and `media_marker`.
- Image URLs may be `data:`, `http://`, or `https://`. `file://` is disabled
  unless the serving `gpuf-c` process sets `GPUF_ALLOW_FILE_IMAGE_URLS=1`, and
  should only be used for trusted local tests.
- Vision/OCR models must start `gpuf-c` with a matching
  `--llama-mmproj-path`.

`docs/gpuf-openai-compatible-api.md`.

# Compute Map API

## GET `/api/compute-map`
Get nationwide city-level compute map data. This endpoint returns raw JSON, not
`ApiResponse<T>`.

### Response `ComputeMapResponse`
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| summary | ComputeMapSummary\|null | Returns inventory totals and token aggregates from `inference_token_usage` |
| nodes | ComputeMapNode[] | City-level aggregation, not per-device details |
| links | ComputeMapLink[] | Currently `[]`; future route/traffic metrics can populate it |

`ComputeMapSummary`:
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| onlineNodes | number | Strict online mapped node count, normalized from `client_status` |
| totalTflops | number | Real aggregated TFLOPS from `system_info.total_tflops` |
| tokenTps | number | Exact average token TPS from the latest 10-second window; may contain decimals |
| todayTokenTotal | number | Exact raw token count today, not display-scaled |
| todayTokenUnit | string | `tokens` |
| usedNodes | number | Best-effort used node count from real model assignment and telemetry load |

`ComputeMapNode`:
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | string | Derived stable city id from `gpu_assets.geo_city`, e.g. `beijing` |
| name | string | Derived city display name, e.g. `北京` |
| lng | number | Longitude; static known-city coordinate or averaged stored geo coordinate |
| lat | number | Latitude; static known-city coordinate or averaged stored geo coordinate |
| nodeCount | number | Real city aggregated inventory count |
| tflops | number | Real city aggregated TFLOPS from `system_info.total_tflops` |
| gpuModel | string\|null | Real top device model names from `device_info.device_name`, joined with `/` |
| region | string\|null | Derived compute region, e.g. `华北算力区` |
| status | string | Derived from `client_status` and `valid_status`: `online`, `warning`, `offline`, or `maintenance` |

`ComputeMapLink`:
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| from | string | Reserved for future route source |
| to | string | Reserved for future route source |
| value | number | Link weight |

### Data Rules
- Uses `gpu_assets.geo_country`, `geo_city`, `geo_latitude`, `geo_longitude`,
  `client_status`, `valid_status`, `system_info.total_tflops`, and
  `device_info.device_name`.
- Includes only rows with valid/warning status and usable city coordinates.
- Limits the nationwide map to China/CN/中国/HK/Macau/Taiwan geo country
  values, while allowing null country for backward-compatible test data.
- `links` is empty until a reliable city-to-city route/traffic source exists.

### Field Authenticity
| Category | Fields | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Real persisted data | `nodes[].nodeCount`, `nodes[].tflops`, `nodes[].gpuModel`, `summary.totalTflops` | Aggregated from currently persisted database rows |
| Real status-derived data | `nodes[].status`, `summary.onlineNodes` | Calculated from persisted `client_status` and `valid_status` |
| Best-effort usage data | `summary.usedNodes` | Count of online nodes with assigned model metadata or current telemetry load >= 5% |
| Geo-derived/static data | `nodes[].id`, `name`, `lng`, `lat`, `region` | Derived from persisted geo fields; known Chinese cities use built-in city coordinates/regions for stable frontend display |
| Token usage data | `summary.tokenTps`, `summary.todayTokenTotal` | Aggregated from `inference_token_usage`; `todayTokenTotal` is exact raw token count |
| Placeholder data | `links` | Returned as `[]` in v1 because there is no persisted route source yet |

### Missing API Logic In V1
| Missing logic | Current behavior | Needed source/implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Exact serving-allocation state | `summary.usedNodes` is a best-effort derived value, not an exact scheduler allocation count | Persist inference/allocation/session state if the product needs exact serving workload occupancy |
| Historical token backfill | Token aggregates only include rows recorded after `inference_token_usage` is deployed | Backfill from older logs only if historical token charts are required |
| City network links | `links` is always `[]` | Add route, traffic, scheduling, or data-flow metrics between city ids |
| Geo freshness flag | Response does not distinguish backfilled/test geo from freshly reported geo | Store/report geo source and last update time, e.g. `geo_source`, `geo_updated_at` |

Test environment note: historical offline devices may have geo fields filled by a
test backfill script so the map has enough display data. When a real device
reports fresh public IP/geo data, the persisted geo fields are expected to be
updated by the normal ingest flow.

### Example
```bash
curl "http://<host>:18081/api/compute-map"
```

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "onlineNodes": 1,
    "totalTflops": 80,
    "tokenTps": 0,
    "todayTokenTotal": 62,
    "todayTokenUnit": "tokens",
    "usedNodes": 0
  },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "beijing",
      "name": "北京",
      "lng": 116.4074,
      "lat": 39.9042,
      "nodeCount": 1,
      "tflops": 80,
      "gpuModel": "H100",
      "region": "华北算力区",

}
```

# Banking Admin API

These endpoints back the `/banking/admin` dashboard. The first version uses
only currently persisted node inventory fields from `gpu_assets`,
`system_info`, and `device_info`.

## Data Authenticity Legend

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Real | Directly read from persisted tables or aggregated from persisted rows |
| Derived | Calculated/normalized from real persisted rows, or mapped through built-in city/region rules |
| Placeholder | Fixed `0`, empty array, or generated series kept only to satisfy the frontend contract |
| Test backfill possible | The field can be real in production, but test data may include historical/demo backfill values |

Current real persisted sources are:

- `gpu_assets`: `client_id`, `client_name`, `client_status`, `valid_status`, `os_type`, geo fields, timestamps
- `system_info`: `total_tflops`, CPU/memory/disk usage, timestamps
- `device_info`: device rows, GPU model names, GPU usage, timestamps
- `inference_token_usage`: inference token usage rows written by gpuf-s gateway

## Version 1 Support Matrix

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| City/node inventory | Supported | Derived from `gpu_assets` geo/status fields |
| Online node count | Supported | Counts normalized `active`/`online` nodes |
| GPU model/count | Supported | Aggregated from `device_info.device_name` and device rows |
| TFLOPS | Supported | Aggregated from `system_info.total_tflops`, unit is TFLOPS |
| Used nodes/devices | Best-effort supported | Counts online nodes with assigned model metadata or current telemetry load >= 5% |
| OS/device filter | Supported | Normalizes `gpu_assets.os_type` to `linux/windows/mac/unknown` |
| Region/city filter | Supported | Supports city id/name, province, region id, and region name where applicable |
| `from` / `to` on overview | Partially supported | Applies to the token total card when both values are valid; other overview cards remain current-state values |
| Token TPS / token totals | Supported | Aggregated from `inference_token_usage` |
| Network links | Not supported in v1 | Returned as `[]`; no route/traffic source yet |
| Token `region` filter | Supported | Matches `gpu_assets.geo_city` or `geo_region` for the serving node |
| Token reconciliation | Supported | Use exact raw token fields; do not reconcile against scaled display fields |
| Compute node `owner` | Best-effort supported | Uses `gpu_assets.user_id` when present; falls back to `<算力区>节点池` |
| Compute node `load` | Derived fallback | Max of current CPU/memory/disk/GPU usage, not model-serving load |

## Field Authenticity Summary

| Endpoint | Real fields | Derived fields | Placeholder / not real in v1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/overview` | node/compute summary card values, token summary cards, `resourceUsage.totalDevices`, `statusBreakdown.*.nodes`, `statusBreakdown.*.compute` | `resourceUsage.usedDevices`, `resourceUsage.usageRate`, `summaryCards[].displayValue`, `clusterStack[].percent`, `statusBreakdown.*.resourceUsage`, `statusBreakdown.*.clusterStack` | none for current summary surface |
| `/network-map` | `cities[].nodes`, `cities[].tflops`, `cities[].gpuModel`, `cities[].onlineNodes`, `topCities[]` | `cities[].id/name/province/coord/tier`, `cities[].usedNodes`, `regions[]`, `highlightProvinces[]` | `links` |
| `/compute-nodes` | `id`, `owner` when `user_id` exists, `name` when `client_name` exists, `gpuModel`, `gpuCount`, `tokensPerSecond`, `lastSeenAt` | fallback `name`, fallback `owner`, `region`, `regionId`, `device`, `status`, `gpu`, `load`, `lastSeenText` | none for current node table surface |
| `/token-throughput` | `input`, `output`, `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `totalTokens`, peak values, timestamps from `inference_token_usage` buckets | empty buckets are generated as zero points for chart continuity | none for current throughput surface |

## Token Reconciliation Rules

- Use raw token fields for accounting: `summary.todayTokenTotal`,
  `summaryCards[].value`, `points[].inputTokens`, `points[].outputTokens`,
  `points[].totalTokens`, and `totals.totalTokens`.
- Use `displayValue` and units such as `K`, `M`, `B`, `T`, or `tokens` only for
  UI display. They are not the source of truth for reconciliation.
- `input` and `output` in throughput payloads are exact tokens-per-second rates
  for the selected interval, so they can be decimal values. They are rates, not
  raw token counts.
- `/overview` and `/api/compute-map` daily totals use the database server's
  current calendar day via `date_trunc('day', NOW())`.
- `/token-throughput` uses a rolling window (`NOW() - windowSeconds`). A
  24-hour rolling window is not the same thing as today's calendar-day total.
  For strict reconciliation, query matching time scopes or compare against
  `totals.totalTokens` from the same throughput request.

## Missing API Logic In V1

| Endpoint | Missing logic | Current behavior | Needed source/implementation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/overview` | Full historical filtering by `from`/`to` | The token total card honors valid `from`/`to`; inventory, compute, and usage cards remain current-state values | Add time-series dashboard tables or aggregate snapshots for full historical dashboard views |
| `/overview` | Exact used device/resource usage | `usedDevices` and `usageRate` are best-effort values from model metadata and telemetry load | Persist currently assigned/serving workload state if exact scheduler occupancy is required |
| `/overview` | Historical token backfill | Token TPS and daily token total start from newly recorded `inference_token_usage` rows | Backfill from logs only if pre-deployment history is required |
| `/overview` | Real serving load | `clusterStack` only classifies inventory by GPU model family | Add actual serving/resource allocation metrics if frontend needs utilization composition |
| `/network-map` | City-to-city links | `links` is always `[]` | Add scheduling, request flow, bandwidth, or topology source keyed by city ids |
| `/network-map` | Exact used nodes per city | `cities[].usedNodes` is best-effort from model metadata and telemetry load | Same serving/allocation source as overview used devices if exact values are required |
| `/network-map` | Province highlight semantics | Highlights are derived from top TFLOPS/node provinces | Define product semantics if highlight means policy focus, fault area, hot traffic, or sales region |
| `/compute-nodes` | Full owner/account relation | `owner` uses `gpu_assets.user_id` when present, otherwise generated node-pool fallback | Add owner/account/pool table relation if display name/email/org is required |
| `/compute-nodes` | Real model-serving load | `load` is max of CPU/memory/disk/GPU usage | Add workload queue/runtime utilization metric if load means inference load |
| `/compute-nodes` | Historical per-node token rate | `tokensPerSecond` uses the latest 10-second window and starts after `inference_token_usage` is deployed | Backfill from logs only if historical per-node charts are required |
| `/compute-nodes` | Geo data provenance | API does not mark whether geo is real-time reported or test-backfilled | Store/report geo source and update timestamp |
| `/token-throughput` | Historical token backfill | Series starts from newly recorded rows; old requests are not reconstructed | Backfill from logs only if pre-deployment history is required |

### Shared Node Status Filter

`/network-map` supports `nodeStatus` to switch the inventory basis used by city,
province, and top-city aggregations.
`status` is accepted as a backward-compatible alias when `nodeStatus` is absent.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `all` | Default. All currently API-visible inventory rows (`valid`/`warning`) |
| `online` | Nodes whose normalized status is `active` or `online` |
| `offline` | API-visible nodes that are not currently `active`/`online`, including `offline`, `warning`, `maintenance`, and `error` |

Chinese values `全部`, `在线`, and `离线` are also accepted.

Detailed status rules:

- If neither `nodeStatus` nor `status` is provided, the filter is `all`.
- `nodeStatus` has priority over the `status` alias when both are provided.
- Empty strings are treated as absent and therefore default to `all`.
- Invalid values return HTTP `400 Bad Request` with an empty response body in
  the current implementation.
- `all` means all API-visible inventory rows after base filtering. The base
  visibility rule is `COALESCE(gpu_assets.valid_status, 'valid') IN
  ('valid', 'warning')`.
- `online` means the normalized node status is `active` or `online`.
- `offline` means API-visible rows that are not currently `active`/`online`.
  This includes normalized `offline`, `warning`, `maintenance`, and `error`.
- For any fixed region/data snapshot, `online + offline = all` for node count
  and compute.

`/overview` does not accept `nodeStatus`. It always returns all-scope legacy
fields plus a three-way `statusBreakdown` so the frontend can render
all/online/offline metrics without issuing multiple requests.

## GET `/api/banking/admin/overview`
Get summary cards, resource usage, and coarse resource composition.

### Query Parameters
| Param | Type | Optional | v1 Notes |
|---|---:|:---:|---|
| region | string | Yes | Filters by city/region when matched |
| from | ISO8601 string | Yes | Optional start of time range; when both `from`/`to` are valid, total tokens are summed in range |
| to | ISO8601 string | Yes | Optional end of time range; must be later than `from` |

### Response `data`
| Field | Type | v1 Notes |
|---|---|---|
| summaryCards | SummaryCard[] | Presentation-friendly cards. Node and compute cards include online/offline/all dimensions; `totalCompute` is kept for compatibility and equals `allCompute` |
| resourceUsage.totalDevices | number | Real all-scope node count after `region` filtering |
| resourceUsage.usedDevices | number | Best-effort count of online nodes with assigned model metadata or telemetry load >= 5% |
| resourceUsage.usageRate | number | `usedDevices / totalDevices`, rounded percentage |
| clusterStack | ClusterStackItem[] | All-scope cluster composition; derived from GPU model names |
| statusBreakdown | OverviewStatusBreakdown | Three inventory views keyed by `all`, `online`, and `offline` |

Compatibility rules:

- Existing consumers can keep reading `summaryCards[onlineNodes]`,
  `summaryCards[totalCompute]`, `resourceUsage`, and `clusterStack`.
- New consumers should prefer `statusBreakdown` for structured all/online/offline
  comparisons.
- `summaryCards[].value` is the raw value. For compute cards it is raw TFLOPS.
- `summaryCards[].displayValue` and `unit` are display helpers only. Do not use
  them for reconciliation.
- Token cards (`realtimeTokenThroughput`, `todayTokenTotal`) are not split by
  online/offline status. They are time-series aggregates from
  `inference_token_usage`, while node status is current inventory state.

Inventory `summaryCards` keys:
| Key | Label | Raw `value` | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| onlineNodes | 在线节点 | number | 个 | Online node count |
| offlineNodes | 离线节点 | number | 个 | Offline/non-online node count |
| allNodes | 全部节点 | number | 个 | All API-visible node count |
| totalCompute | 总算力 | TFLOPS | PF display unit | All-scope compute, kept for backward compatibility |
| onlineCompute | 在线算力 | TFLOPS | PF display unit | Online compute |
| offlineCompute | 离线算力 | TFLOPS | PF display unit | Offline/non-online compute |
| allCompute | 全部算力 | TFLOPS | PF display unit | All API-visible compute; same raw value as `totalCompute` |

`OverviewStatusMetrics`:
| Field | Type | v1 Notes |
|---|---|---|
| nodes | number | Node count for this status group |
| compute | number | Raw TFLOPS for this status group |
| computeDisplayValue | string | Display-scaled compute value in PF |
| computeUnit | string | `PF` |
| resourceUsage | ResourceUsage | Resource usage computed within this status group |
| clusterStack | ClusterStackItem[] | Cluster composition computed within this status group |

`statusBreakdown` semantics:
| Path | Meaning |
|---|---|
| statusBreakdown.all | All API-visible inventory rows after `region` filtering |
| statusBreakdown.online | Subset whose normalized status is `active` or `online` |
| statusBreakdown.offline | Subset whose normalized status is not `active`/`online` |
| statusBreakdown.*.nodes | Node count in that subset |
| statusBreakdown.*.compute | Raw TFLOPS sum in that subset |
| statusBreakdown.*.resourceUsage.totalDevices | Same as `statusBreakdown.*.nodes` |
| statusBreakdown.*.resourceUsage.usedDevices | Best-effort used count within that subset |
| statusBreakdown.*.clusterStack | GPU family percentages within that subset |

## GET `/api/banking/admin/network-map`
Get city-level map nodes, region groups, highlighted provinces, and top cities.

### Query Parameters
| Param | Type | Optional | v1 Notes |
|---|---:|:---:|---|
| nodeStatus | string | Yes | `all`/`online`/`offline`; default is `all`; filters inventory rows before computing `cities`, `regions`, `highlightProvinces`, and `topCities` |
| status | string | Yes | Alias for `nodeStatus` when `nodeStatus` is absent |

### Response `data`
| Field | Type | v1 Notes |
|---|---|---|
| cities | NetworkCity[] | Real city-level aggregation after `nodeStatus` filtering, not per-device details |
| links | NetworkLink[] | Always `[]` in v1 |
| regions | NetworkRegion[] | Static region definitions with city ids that still have data after `nodeStatus` filtering |
| highlightProvinces | HighlightProvince[] | Derived from top provinces by TFLOPS/nodes after `nodeStatus` filtering |
| topCities | TopCity[] | Top 5 cities within the filtered node set, sorted by TFLOPS desc, node count desc, then city id asc |

`NetworkCity`:
| Field | Type | v1 Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | string | Stable city id |
| name | string | City display name |
| province | string | Map province name |
| coord | [number, number] | `[lng, lat]` |
| nodes | number | City node count |
| tflops | number | City total TFLOPS |
| gpuModel | string | Top GPU models joined with `/`, or `Unknown` |
| tier | string | `mega/large/medium/small` from TFLOPS/node count |
| onlineNodes | number | Count of `active`/`online` nodes |
| usedNodes | number | Best-effort count of used nodes in this city |

Filtering examples:

```bash
# Default: all visible nodes, same as nodeStatus=all
curl "http://<host>:18081/api/banking/admin/network-map"

# Online city/top-city view
curl "http://<host>:18081/api/banking/admin/network-map?nodeStatus=online"

# Offline/non-online city/top-city view
curl "http://<host>:18081/api/banking/admin/network-map?nodeStatus=offline"
```

Important frontend notes:

- `topCities` is recalculated after the filter. For
  `nodeStatus=offline`, it is the top 5 offline/non-online city set.
- `cities[].nodes` and `cities[].tflops` are also recalculated after the filter.
- `cities[].onlineNodes` keeps its literal meaning. For
  `nodeStatus=offline`, it is usually `0`.
- When no `nodeStatus` is provided, the API returns all visible nodes, including
  online and offline/non-online nodes.

### Example
```bash
curl "http://<host>:18081/api/banking/admin/network-map?nodeStatus=offline"
```

## GET `/api/banking/admin/token-throughput`
Get the time-series payload shape for the token throughput chart.

### Query Parameters
| Param | Type | Optional | v1 Notes |
|---|---:|:---:|---|
| windowSeconds | number | Yes | Default `180`, max `86400`; controls aggregation window |
| intervalSeconds | number | Yes | Default `3`, max `300`; backend may raise it to keep at most 600 returned points while covering the whole window |
| region | string | Yes | Filters by city or region name when matched |

### Response `data`
Throughput values are aggregated from `inference_token_usage`. Empty buckets are
returned as `0` so charts remain continuous. `input`/`output` are exact
tokens-per-second rates for the selected interval and may contain decimals.
`inputTokens`/`outputTokens`/`totalTokens` are exact raw token counts in that
bucket. `totals` is the exact sum of all returned buckets and is the field to
use for strict reconciliation. `latest` is always the latest bucket, even when
it is zero. `region` filters by the serving node's `geo_city` or `geo_region`.

## Compute Asset Pre-Evaluation

These management APIs require `Authorization: Bearer <GPUF_BANKING_API_TOKEN>`.
The configured token must contain at least 32 characters. Legacy clients may omit `supplements` or send an empty object. Non-empty ownership, direct benchmark values, valuation, pledge-rate, or manual specification input is rejected with HTTP `422`.

Online and offline create requests may include `Idempotency-Key`. Its scope is the SHA-256-redacted service subject, tenant, and operation. The same key and request reuses the first report; the same key with a different request returns HTTP `409`. Omitting the header preserves legacy behavior. `GPUF_BANKING_SERVICE_SUBJECT` names the caller, while the database stores no raw subject or tenant identifier.
This is a service-to-service management credential and must not be shipped to browser code.
Production deployments may set comma-separated `GPUF_BANKING_API_TOKENS` during token
rotation. `GPUF_BANKING_API_TOKEN` remains as the single-token compatibility setting.

Internal orchestrators can use the equivalent aliases below. They share the same
authorization, body limits, evidence validation, idempotency store, and report generator:

```text
POST /internal/v1/technical-pre-evaluations/from-client
POST /internal/v1/technical-pre-evaluations/challenge
POST /internal/v1/technical-pre-evaluations/from-evidence
```

The internal request form accepts `gpufUserRef`, `gpufClientRef`, `tenantRef`, and
`clientRequestId`. `gpufUserRef`/`gpufClientRef` are aliases for the legacy
`userId`/`clientId` fields. A body `clientRequestId` enables idempotency without a
header. If both `clientRequestId` and `Idempotency-Key` are present, they must match or
the request returns HTTP `400`. Explicit tenant references are validated and only their
SHA-256-derived scope is persisted.

### POST `/api/banking/provider/benchmark-evidence`

A controlled benchmark runner registers signed evidence before a pre-evaluation references it through `benchmarkEvidenceIds`. Registration uses a separate `GPUF_BENCHMARK_PRODUCER_TOKEN`. The server selects `keyId` from `GPUF_BENCHMARK_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEYS_JSON` and verifies the exact UTF-8 `payloadJson` bytes with Ed25519. The payload binds a 64-hex technical `sourceRef`, parameter SHA-256, test time, and a maximum 30-day validity window. Evidence rows are insert-only.

When `benchmarkEvidenceIds` is non-empty, the server loads exactly those evidence records. An empty list auto-selects the latest unexpired signed record for each metric under the current technical `sourceRef`. `scripts/run_signed_ollama_benchmark.sh` registers separate `tokens_per_second` and `sustained_throughput_percent` records in one run. Auto-selection never crosses devices, accepts expired evidence, or executes caller-supplied commands.

Report requests cannot submit arbitrary performance values, commands, scripts, or image URLs. Missing, expired, or cross-device evidence returns HTTP `422`.

### POST `/api/banking/provider/pre-evaluations/from-client`

Creates and persists a draft from `gpu_assets`, `system_info`, `device_info`, and the
latest 30 days of `device_daily_stats`.
When `assetName` is omitted, the report uses the GPU model instead of a client name or
host name. The report exposes a SHA-256 source reference rather than the raw client id.

```json
{
  "userId": "1",
  "clientId": "00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff",
  "assetName": "GPU Node A01",
  "benchmarkEvidenceIds": ["BENCH-2026-07-A01-TPS"]
}
```

### POST `/api/banking/provider/pre-evaluations/challenge`

Issues a single-use challenge with a five-minute TTL. Pass it to
`hw-asset-collector --challenge "$CHALLENGE"`.

### POST `/api/banking/provider/pre-evaluations/from-evidence`

Creates a draft from an offline collector document. `hardwareEvidenceJson` must contain
the original report text, normally read with `File.text()`. The server recomputes the
collector hash and atomically consumes the challenge. Invalid hashes, expired challenges,
and replay attempts return HTTP `422`. The raw report limit is 4 MiB.
Only the collector's `serials_redacted` mode is accepted. Reports containing non-null
serials, UUIDs, WWNs, or asset tags return HTTP `422`.

```json
{
  "userId": "1",
  "assetName": "Offline GPU Node 01",
  "offlineAssetRef": "offline-asset:hmac:v1:<opaque>",
  "hardwareEvidenceJson": "<original report.json text>",
  "benchmarkEvidenceIds": []
}
```

Internal orchestrators should provide a stable, tenant-bound, redacted
`offlineAssetRef`. GPUFabric maps it to a 64-hex `sourceRef` with the fixed
`gpuf.offline_asset_source.v1` profile while retaining collector
`payloadSha256` only for the current challenge's integrity. Omitting the field
keeps the legacy per-payload source behavior. A controlled runner must register
benchmarks for the stable source before the same collector JSON is submitted;
an empty `benchmarkEvidenceIds` then auto-associates the signed evidence.

Build the request without reserializing the collector document:

```bash
jq -Rs --arg userId "1" --arg assetName "Offline GPU Node 01" \
  '{userId: $userId, assetName: $assetName, hardwareEvidenceJson: .}' \
  report.json > request.json
```

### GET `/api/banking/provider/pre-evaluations/{reportId}`

Returns the insert-only JSON snapshot saved when the report was created. A separate
SHA-256 is checked before returning the document. Missing reports return HTTP `404`.

### GET `/api/banking/provider/pre-evaluations/{reportId}/html`

Returns the frozen technical pre-evaluation HTML bytes. `Content-Type` is `text/html; charset=utf-8`; `ETag` and `X-Content-SHA256` declare the `gpuf.report-html-bytes.v1` byte hash. Reads recompute the hash and fail with HTTP `500` on mismatch. The HTML contains technical facts, trusted benchmarks, and structured gaps only.

### GET `/internal/v1/technical-pre-evaluations/{reportId}`

Returns the immutable v1 report as a byte-integrity envelope with `reportJson`,
`reportSha256`, and `hashProfile: gpuf.report-json-bytes.v1`. New reports contain an
optional `reportHtmlSha256`, `htmlHashProfile: gpuf.report-html-bytes.v1`, and additive `technicalSnapshot` references; older clients may ignore them.

### GET `/internal/v2/technical-snapshots/{snapshotId}`

Returns `snapshotJson`, `snapshotSha256`, `hashProfile: gpuf.snapshot-json-bytes.v2`,
and the parsed snapshot. Each non-null technical leaf has provenance and one of
`measured`, `observed`, `collected`, `catalog`, or `derived`. The snapshot excludes
ownership conclusions, market values, pledge rates, loan amounts, and bank decisions.

A complete homogeneous GPU inventory backed by the server catalog also contains an
`assetConfiguration` using schema `gpuf.asset_configuration.v1` and hash profile
`gpuf.asset-configuration-lines.v1`. Its SHA-256 input is the exact UTF-8 byte sequence
below, including the final newline:

```text
gpuf.asset_configuration.v1
canonicalModelId=<canonicalModelId>
deviceForm=<deviceForm>
gpuCount=<base-10 integer>
memoryPerGpuBytes=<base-10 integer>
```

The object is omitted when catalog identity/form is unavailable, inventory is incomplete,
or model, form, or per-GPU memory differs across devices. GPUFabric does not guess a
market-comparable configuration.

### DELETE `/api/banking/provider/pre-evaluations/{reportId}/evidence`

Purges temporarily retained raw offline JSON while preserving its SHA-256, the report
snapshot, and the purge timestamp. The operation is idempotent and returns
`rawEvidencePurged: false` when no raw document remains.

Raw offline JSON is not stored by default. Set
`GPUF_PRE_EVALUATION_STORE_RAW_EVIDENCE=true` to opt in and configure
`GPUF_PRE_EVALUATION_RAW_EVIDENCE_TTL_DAYS` from 1 to 90 days; the default enabled TTL
is 30 days. The API process sweeps expired evidence hourly. When `assetName` is omitted,
the report uses the GPU model and does not copy the collector host name into the snapshot.

Offline integrity is labeled `self_reported_challenge_bound`: it detects transport-time
tampering and replay, but is not equivalent to TPM/TEE or vendor hardware attestation.
The v3 hash covers collector metadata, the challenge, and hardware only. Unhashed
`attestation.evidence_sources`, `warnings`, and `missing_evidence` are not copied into
the assessment.
The report snapshot remains immutable. Raw collector text is omitted by default and may
be purged after temporary retention without deleting its integrity hash.

The evidence score and grade measure technical evidence quality only. They are not hardware performance or bank credit scores. New reports keep `valuation` null and both `eligibleForListing` and `eligibleForCreditPrecheck` false. Stable `missingCodes`, `warningCodes`, and `nextActions` accompany compatibility text fields.
Online reports use `authenticated_client_telemetry`, which identifies authenticated
`gpuf-c` telemetry and must not be interpreted as server-side hardware attestation.

GPU specifications are enriched server-side without changing the legacy `gpuf-c/common`
protocol. Per-GPU specifications remain per-GPU. Heterogeneous nodes do not receive a
single architecture, TDP, or bandwidth value; node-level interconnect bandwidth remains
empty until topology evidence exists. Legacy total VRAM is not divided across multiple
GPUs. If the reported GPU count differs from the per-GPU inventory, partial per-GPU
specifications are not treated as node totals and the asset is not listing-eligible.
